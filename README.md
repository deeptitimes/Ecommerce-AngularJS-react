# AngularJS_Ecommerce
A sample ecommerce system developed in AngularJS, MySQL, PHP using Bootstrap

This is an ecommerce system developed using AngularJS, MySQL, PHP and Bootstrap. This has almost all the features similar to what we see daily on web. The important thing is that
it has many cool and realtime features which can be adapted to any new system.

The system provides the following features:
1)Add,Edit,Delete items - items have quantities, images, and other major attributes, such as the price

2)Bidding on item - bids can be placed (as we do in eBay) - there is also an in-built system bidder, which enforces the users to increase the bid until the bid amount reaches a certain threshold.

3)Limited time offer - items can be placed on sale by setting the quantity of item to be kept for sale, the time of sale start, and the time of sale end

4)Notifications - the system notification is an important feature that notifies users about the outbid notification, the bid winning notification and so forth

5)Payment integration with PayPal

and many more.

Thank you.
